# CV Improver - Guidelines

This skill critiques resumes the way a recruiter or hiring manager reads them: fast filtering, low patience for vague phrasing, and a bias toward evidence of impact.

Intended CV improvement pipeline:

1. Critique (mandatory)
2. Rewrite (on demand, no invention)
3. Post-rewrite recruiter review (on demand)

## Core rule: critique, don’t rewrite

- Quote weak/vague phrases exactly as written.
- Explain why they read as weak from a recruiter’s perspective.
- Describe what evidence is missing (metrics, scope, stakes, ownership), but do not provide replacement sentences.

A useful pattern is: **Quote → Diagnosis → What’s missing**.

## Rewrite rule: improve wording, don’t invent

- Keep the candidate’s actual experience and skills.
- Do not add metrics, titles, dates, employers, tools, or achievements that are not present.
- Only change wording and emphasis.
- Prefer results/outcomes over process descriptions.

If important details are missing, ask for them instead of guessing.

## Post-rewrite recruiter review (updated resume)

Read the updated resume again as a recruiter and answer:

- what are the candidate's 3 strongest points that are immediately visible
- for which role do they look most convincing
- does the resume make you want to invite them for an interview, and why

If not, point out what is holding it back and how to fix it.

### How to judge “invite to interview”

Use a recruiter’s default constraints:

- Signal appears fast (top half-page): role fit, level, impact.
- Claims are credible: scope, context, ownership.
- Risk is acceptable: no obvious gaps, no inflated seniority, no unclear story.

### How to propose fixes (without rewriting the whole CV)

- Point to specific sections that weaken the decision.
- Provide a short checklist of what to add/clarify (metrics, scope, ownership, tech depth).
- If the fix needs new facts, ask targeted questions instead of suggesting invented numbers.

## What recruiters screen for

### Value signals (advance cues)

- Clear role + level (scope, seniority, decision-making).
- Outcomes, not tasks (what changed because of the person).
- Magnitude (numbers, deltas, scale, constraints).
- Ownership (built/led/owned vs “assisted/participated”).
- Credibility (specific tech, constraints, timelines, production usage).
- Relevance (alignment to target role; strong signal early).

### Fast reject cues

- Mostly “responsibilities” with no results.
- Generic adjectives with no proof ("results-driven", "dynamic", "passionate").
- Claims that don’t pass the sniff test (no scope, no context, no artifacts).
- Unclear story: mismatched titles, confusing timelines, unexplained moves.
- Keyword soup: tools listed without showing applied depth.

## Common weak/vague phrase patterns

- **Empty adjectives**: "results-driven", "highly motivated", "innovative", "strategic".
- **Responsibility bullets**: "Responsible for…", "Worked on…", "Helped with…".
- **Ambiguous impact**: "Improved performance", "Optimized system", "Reduced costs" (missing baseline and delta).
- **Unscoped leadership**: "Led a team" (how many? what did leadership mean?).
- **Fuzzy scale**: "high traffic", "large dataset", "enterprise" (what scale?).
- **Tool listing**: a long tech stack with no evidence of usage depth.

## What to call out in the breakdown

### Weak/vague phrasing

For each item, include:

- The exact phrase (quoted)
- Why it reads weak/vague
- What a recruiter can’t infer (scope, ownership, magnitude, relevance)

### Value gaps

- Missing metrics: baseline, delta, timeframe.
- Missing scale: users, QPS, data volume, latency budgets, uptime.
- Missing constraints: cost, compute limits, compliance, deadlines.
- Missing decision-making: trade-offs, why X not Y.
- Missing artifacts: shipped feature, production system, paper/patent, open-source, talk.

### Invite-to-next-stage blockers

Bluntly identify reasons a hiring manager might not advance the resume, e.g.:

- Can’t tell what you actually delivered.
- Seniority looks overstated/unclear.
- Impact is not evidenced.
- Role fit is not obvious in the first half-page.

### Questions to answer

Ask questions that, if answered, would materially improve the decision signal:

- "What was the baseline and what changed?"
- "What was your ownership vs the team’s?"
- "What scale were you operating at?"
- "What constraint made this hard?"
- "What proof can you point to (prod usage, metrics, links)?"

## Handling PDFs

If the resume is attached as a PDF and the text is not available, ask the user to paste the resume text (or key sections: Summary, last 2 roles, top projects, Skills).
